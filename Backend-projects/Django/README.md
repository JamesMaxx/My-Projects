# Django Projects

This folder contains various Django projects that I have worked on. Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern and provides many built-in features and utilities for building secure and maintainable web applications.

## Key Features of Django

- **Model-View-Template (MVT) Architecture**: Django follows the MVT pattern, which separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model (data access layer), the View (presentation layer), and the Template (display layer).

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: Django's ORM allows you to interact with databases using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries, making it easier to work with databases and handle database migrations.

- **Admin Interface**: Django comes with a built-in admin interface that allows you to manage your application's data through a web-based interface.

- **URL Routing**: Django's URL routing system maps URLs to Python functions, making it easy to create clean and SEO-friendly URLs.

- **Template System**: Django's template system allows you to separate the presentation logic from the application logic, making it easier to maintain and update the user interface.

- **Form Handling**: Django provides a powerful form handling system that simplifies the process of handling user input and validating data.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Django includes a built-in authentication system that handles user accounts, groups, permissions, and cookie-based user sessions.

- **Internationalization and Localization**: Django supports internationalization and localization out of the box, making it easier to create applications that can be translated into multiple languages and adapt to different cultures and regions.

## Getting Started

To get started with Django, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can then install Django using pip, the Python package installer:


pip install django


Once you have Django installed, you can create a new project and start building your web application. Django provides a command-line utility called `django-admin` that helps you manage your projects and applications.

For more information on getting started with Django, you can refer to the official Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/
