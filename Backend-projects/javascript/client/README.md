This is a minimal placeholder for the Angular frontend.

Recommended: replace this with a real Angular app scaffolded with the Angular CLI:

```bash
npx @angular/cli@16 new client --directory . --routing --style=css
```

After generating, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` inside `/client`.

When deploying to Vercel set build command to `npm run build --prefix client` and output directory to `client/dist/<project-name>`.
