# Fun With Languages and Becoming a Full Stack Developer

Hello, welcome to my journey of learning and exploring various programming languages! I'm also learning software engineering with a major in backend development, and I'm excited to integrate AI into my projects. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled full stack developer, capable of building complete web applications from front-end to back-end. Let's get started!

## Languages I'm currently working on

- **Python**: I'm currently learning Python and it's amazing! I'm loving the simplicity and readability of the language. Python will serve as a strong foundation for backend development and data analysis. ✅
- **JavaScript**: I'm diving into the world of JavaScript and I can't wait to explore all its capabilities. From front-end to back-end, JavaScript is truly versatile. Mastering JavaScript will allow me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. ✅
- **Python**: I've heard great things about Python, so I'm eager to dive into this beautiful language. I'm excited to learn about its elegant syntax and the Flask framework, which will enable me to build robust and scalable web applications. ✅
- **Django**: I'm curious about the Django web framework and I'm eager to learn about its model-view-template architecture and powerful admin interface. Django will provide me with a comprehensive toolset for building complex web applications. ✅
- **FAST Api**: I've always been fascinated by the FAST Api framework. I'm excited to learn about its modern syntax and how it integrates with web development. FAST Api will allow me to create efficient and high-performance APIs for my web applications. ✅

## Languages I want to learn

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. I'm intrigued by its ability to catch errors early and its compatibility with the large JavaScript ecosystem. Learning TypeScript will enhance my front-end development skills and improve code maintainability.
- **Kotlin**: Kotlin is a statically-typed language that runs on the JVM. I'm drawn to its simplicity, compatibility with Java, and the Android platform. Mastering Kotlin will enable me to develop mobile applications for the Android ecosystem.
- **ReasonML**: I'm excited to learn about the ReasonML language, which is a statically-typed dialect of JavaScript. It's a great way to leverage the power of JavaScript while having the benefits of a typed language. ReasonML will provide me with an alternative approach to front-end development.
- **Rust**: I'm excited to learn about the Rust programming language. It's a fast, secure, and safe language that's perfect for backend development. Rust will allow me to build high-performance and reliable server-side applications.

## AI is part of my learning journey

I'm excited to integrate AI into my projects as much as possible. I'm learning about machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. I'm eager to apply AI techniques to build intelligent applications that can enhance the user experience and provide valuable insights.

## How you can follow my learning journey

- **Blog posts**: I plan to share my learning experiences and projects on this website. You can find my latest blog posts on the homepage, where I'll document my progress and share insights from my full stack development journey.
- **Code snippets**: I'll be sharing code snippets and examples on this website as well. You can find them on the relevant projects, showcasing my work across various languages and frameworks.
- **Social media**: I'm active on Twitter, where I share my thoughts, projects, and learnings. You can follow me there to stay updated on my progress and connect with me as I navigate the world of full stack development.

So, that's a brief overview of my language learning journey and my path to becoming a skilled full stack developer. I hope you'll join me on this exciting journey of exploring various programming languages, backend development, front-end development, and integrating AI into my projects. Let's have some fun and learn together!
