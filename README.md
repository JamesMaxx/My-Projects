# Fun With Languages 🚀

Hello, welcome to my journey of learning and exploring various programming languages! I'm also learning software engineering with a major in backend development, and I'm excited to integrate AI into my projects. Let's get started! 💻

## Languages I'm currently working on

- **Python**: I'm currently learning Python and it's amazing! I'm loving the simplicity and readability of the language. ✅
- **JavaScript**: I'm diving into the world of JavaScript and I can't wait to explore all its capabilities. From front-end to back-end, JavaScript is truly versatile. ✅
- **Ruby**: I've heard great things about Ruby, so I'm eager to dive into this beautiful language. I'm excited to learn about its elegant syntax and the Ruby on Rails framework. ✅
- **Go**: I'm curious about the Go language and I'm eager to learn about its simplicity, speed, and concurrent design. ✅
- **Swift**: I've always been fascinated by Apple's Swift language. I'm excited to learn about its modern syntax and how it integrates with iOS and macOS development. ✅

## Languages I want to learn

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. I'm intrigued by its ability to catch errors early and its compatibility with the large JavaScript ecosystem.
- **Kotlin**: Kotlin is a statically-typed language that runs on the JVM. I'm drawn to its simplicity, compatibility with Java, and the Android platform.
- **ReasonML**: I'm excited to learn about the ReasonML language, which is a statically-typed dialect of JavaScript. It's a great way to leverage the power of JavaScript while having the benefits of a typed language.
- **Elixir**: Elixir is a functional language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. I'm interested in learning about its focus on concurrency and the Erlang ecosystem.

## AI is part of my learning journey

I'm excited to integrate AI into my projects as much as possible. I'm learning about machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. I'm eager to apply AI techniques to build intelligent applications. 🤖

## How you can follow my learning journey

- **Blog posts**: I plan to share my learning experiences and projects on this website. You can find my latest blog posts on the homepage. 📝
- **Code snippets**: I'll be sharing code snippets and examples on this website as well. You can find them on the relevant projects. 💻
- **Social media**: I'm active on Twitter, where I share my thoughts, projects, and learnings. You can follow me there to stay updated on my progress. 🐦

So, that's a brief overview of my language learning journey. I hope you'll join me on this exciting journey of exploring various programming languages, backend development, and integrating AI into my projects. Let's have some fun and learn together! 🎉
